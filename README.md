# ðŸ“¦ React Portfolio Project

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and serves as a starting point for building a scalable, responsive React application.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadhamza14210/Portfolio.git
npm install
npm start
```

The app will open at http://localhost:3000 in your default browser. The page will reload when you make edits, and youâ€™ll see lint errors in the console if any exist.
